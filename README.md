## 📍 Overview

This project focuses on identifying phishing URLs using machine learning algorithms. It extracts key lexical, domain-based, and technical features from URLs to distinguish between legitimate and phishing websites.

A variety of classification algorithms are implemented and evaluated, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

---

## 👾 Features

- 🔍 Feature extraction from URLs
- 🧠 Multiple machine learning models implemented
- 📈 Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- 📊 Confusion matrix and classification report visualization
- 🧪 Train-test data split with reproducible results
- ✅ Supports binary classification (Phishing / Legitimate)
